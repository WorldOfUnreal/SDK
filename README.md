# Unity3D SDK Specification

Version: 0.1

Motivation

During our developing of Cosmicrafts, we discover there is no easy way to communicate Unity3D with Internet Computer
This bring us to the question is there an SDK for this? 

Set of libraries that expects to receive a .DID file which will interpret and generate the necessary classes to be able to call the functions of the original file from C#, internally the SDK generates a third file which will act as an interpreter between our .DID and .C, to make the so-called query connections and updates to ICP
